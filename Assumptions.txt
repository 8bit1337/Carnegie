ASSUMPTIONS
- The program will be called with the proper number (1) and type (string) of parameter.
- The number of samples will be static at 200, and not a parameter
- A sensorid is akin to a serial number, and is therefore unique to each sensor.
- Since there are only 15,615 unique IDs in the file of 22,981 records, there is a one to many relationship between sensors and sensortypes.
